Hi there! My name is Ruijia Zhang. I am currently engaged in postdoctoral research at Peking University, working under the guidance of [Yuguang Shi](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/jsdw/js_20180628175159671361/s_20180628175159671361/69954.htm).
In 2022, I earned my Ph.D. from Tsinghua University under the supervision of Professor [Haizhong Li](https://www.math.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1125/1931.htm).
My research focused on geometric analysis and nonlinear PDE, particularly on the convergence analysis and asymptotic shape characterization of hypersurface curvature flows in space forms.

## News
- [12/2024] I successfully defended my PhD thesis! A huge thank-you to my examiners Dr. [Nikolas Kantas](https://www.ma.imperial.ac.uk/~nkantas/) and Prof. [Chris Oates](https://oates.work/) for the insightful discussions during the viva!

- [08/2024] From 12th to 16th August 2024, I will attend the 11th Bernoulli-IMS World Congress in Probability and Statistics, and present our recent preprint [On the Robustness of Kernel Goodness-of-Fit Tests](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2408.05854), a joint work with Dr [François-Xavier Briol](https://fxbriol.github.io/). Come and join our session on Wednesday 14th at 11am if you are interested!

- [08/2024] Our new preprint [On the Robustness of Kernel Goodness-of-Fit Tests](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2408.05854) is out! This is a joint work with Dr [François-Xavier Briol](https://fxbriol.github.io/).

- [12/2023] From 17th to 21st, I will attend the 2023 IMS International Conference on Statistics and Data Science (ICSDS) in Lisbon, where I will give a contributed talk on our COLT paper [A High-dimensional Convergence Theorem for U-statistics with Applications to Kernel-based Testing](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v195/huang23a.html).

- [10/2023] For this academic year, I will be visiting the [Fundamentals of Statistical Machine Learning](https://fsml-ucl.github.io/) research group, co-led by Dr [François-Xavier Briol](https://fxbriol.github.io/) and Dr [Jeremias Knoblauch](https://jeremiasknoblauch.github.io/). Looking forward to an engaging experience with the amazing researchers in the group!

- [10/2023] Starting from October 2023, I will become an [Enrichment Student](https://www.turing.ac.uk/work-turing/studentships/enrichment) at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk/), where I will join the Turing's research community for six months to broaden my research. Please do not hesitate to reach out if you are interested in collaboration!

- [05/2023] Our paper [A High-dimensional Convergence Theorem for U-statistics with Applications to Kernel-based Testing](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v195/huang23a.html) has been accepted by COLT 2023.
