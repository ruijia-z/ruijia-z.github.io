Hi there! My name is Ruijia Zhang. I am currently engaged in postdoctoral research at Peking University, working under the guidance of Professor [Yuguang Shi](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/jsdw/js_20180628175159671361/s_20180628175159671361/69954.htm).
In 2023, I earned my Ph.D. from Tsinghua University under the supervision of Professor [Haizhong Li](https://www.math.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1125/1931.htm).
My research interests lie in differential geometry and partial differential equations, with a recent focus on geometric flows and their applications.

My short CV can be downloaded [here](http://ruijia-z.github.io/files/CV_zh_zrj.pdf).
