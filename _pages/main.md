Hi there! My name is Ruijia Zhang. I am currently engaged in postdoctoral research at Peking University, working under the guidance of [Yuguang Shi](https://www.math.pku.edu.cn/jsdw/js_20180628175159671361/s_20180628175159671361/69954.htm).
In 2022, I earned my Ph.D. from Tsinghua University under the supervision of Professor [Haizhong Li](https://www.math.tsinghua.edu.cn/info/1125/1931.htm).
My research mainly focused on geometric analysis and nonlinear PDE, particularly on the convergence analysis and asymptotic shape characterization of hypersurface curvature flows in space forms.

My short CV can be downloaded [here](http://ruijia-z.github.io/files/CV_Xing_LIU.pdf).
